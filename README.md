# Bin-Packing-EA-Java
An example of a functional Evolutionary Algorithm that can effectively solve a bin packing problem instance.

Bin weight capacity and number of bins are completely flexible and there are pre-populated test input files with a range of item weight values to draw from.

Multiple crossover operators are available for testing and a results.txt file is included to record algorithm run details for reference.
